# Connect Four

This is a simple Rust version of a famous Connect-4 board game where players try to get 4 of the same color in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally. The game is played between two players, player 1 and player 2.

The project was done as part of the IT 305 Programming Languages course at International Burch University, and implemented in the Rust programming language.
